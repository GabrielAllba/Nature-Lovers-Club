## General Informations
Codecademy, as part of the Full-stack Engineering Career Path training requires it's students to make a responsive  website after following the responsive website with flexbox section.

## Project Requirements
In this project, you’ll build a webpage for a local club. You can base it on real-life organization you belong to or make one up! You’ll get to choose everything about your page: the club name, the page layout and styling, any images that you want to use, and more!<br>
Your project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools you learned. In our example project, we use percentages and relative units, such as em and rem, in our CSS to size and position page elements. We also made our website responsive by incorporating media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen.
<br>
Possible responsive design concepts to demonstrate:​
<br>
- Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size.
- Using a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
- Employing responsive units em and rem to size and space elements with width and padding.

## Technologies
- JavaScript ES6
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
